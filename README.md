Features
    Navigation
        At top left of the page is the name of the website: Drone Studio that links to the website.

        The other navigation links are to the right: Home, Motion, Graphic and Contact which link to different web pages. 

        Navigation is in a font that contrast with the background.

        Navigation is easy to understand.

    Drone Studio text tell that they want to bring you pictures by the help of drones. 

Motion

Contact
    Contact form with firstname, lastname, and email

Testing
    I confirm that the navigation, header, and buttons all are readable and easy to understand. 

    I confirm that the website is somewhat responsive but could use more work. 

   I have confirmed that the form works, requires entries in last name and email, will only accept email in email field and submit button works. 

 Bugs
 index.html: Section lacks heading. May be fixed by using alternative ways to make a button of the header. 


Validator Testing
    HTML:
        index.html 
        Testet with result that the sections lacks heading. This is a result from making the headings in section above so it can function as a button at the same time.
